<p>Maocan Guo</p>
<p>My research, broadly defined, seeks to understand the production and reproduction of social inequality and stratification patterns in contemporary societies, using China as a case and with an explicit comparative approach. As sociology shifts to mechanism- and processes-based research, my research agenda is two-fold. First, I investigate how different social groups are being incorporated or excluded in a variety of stratification processes and what mechanisms contribute to their respective outcomes. Secondly, given the current stratification patterns in the Chinese society, my research also aims to understand how different social groups perceive, respond and make sense of the mobility and inequality at hand. </p>
<p><strong>The Production and Reproduction of Social Stratification: Mechanisms, Processes and Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>In understanding various stratification processes and outcomes, my first project- which is also my dissertation- looks at the consequences of educational expansion in reforming China, under a comparative framework. The empirical puzzle I address is: under educational expansion, why do the triangular associations among social origin, educational attainment and social destination present various patterns in different societies? Particularly, why in some societies such as China and Russia we observe strengthening associations between family background and educational/occupational attainment, whereas in most industrial societies the associations remain constant, if not weakening? </p>
<p>To understand this empirical puzzle, I treat the triangular relationships among social origin, educational attainment and social destination as a whole, and formally develop a theory to integrate the existing theoretical accounts and results. My theoretical framework has three components. The first component is the mobility strategies adopted by different classes. This part sets up the foundation for a micro-based behavioral model in which we can observe whether different classes’ strategies tend to converge or diverge under educational expansion. The second component is the structural and institutional features in the educational system. They represent the scope conditions that restrict class mobility strategy and behavior. The third component is the sociopolitical institutional context, which looks at how the state affects the organization of the educational system and class structure. Through formal modeling and simulation analysis, I demonstrate that analyzing the interactions among the three components provides a way to interpret how educational expansion affects the entire processes of education-based social stratification and inequality.</p>
<p>Empirically, drawing on a variety of cross-sectional and panel survey data, I use China as a case to illustrate the theoretical framework. My first empirical chapter investigates the relationship between social origin and educational attainment under the context of educational expansion. By analyzing educational transitions at the upper secondary level and above, I find that the advantaged social groups tend to secure educational advantages in steps. When higher education was only modestly expanded, their main advantage was in obtaining senior high school education; when college education was commonly available, they shift their previous advantages from senior high school to college educational attainment. To explain why educational expansion mostly benefits urban children and children from better-off families, I argue that the institutional features of rising educational cost and the bottleneck structure in the Chinese educational system provide a way to interpret the results. The paper based on this chapter, “School Expansion and Educational Stratification in China, 1981-2006,” has received the 2009 Aage B. Sørensen Memorial Award for Best Graduate Student Paper from Harvard Sociology department. It is currently being prepared to be submitted to <em>Sociology of Education</em>.</p>
<p>My second empirical chapter looks at the effects of social origin and educational attainment on people’s first job attainment across different periods, and how people’s first job attainment is subsequently linked to their current job positions. Utilizing a set of life history data and analytical techniques of log-linear/log-multiplicative modeling, I compare the effects of educational attainment on social destination relative to that of social origin across time. I find that the parameter of intergenerational class immobility is highest since the late 1990s, suggesting that under the rapid educational expansion starting from 1999 there is even less social mobility. Compared to their urban counterparts, rural children’s chances of using education for social upward mobility were limited the most since the late 1990s. Based on these results, I argue that China’s recent educational reforms have ironically restricted the upward mobility channel for the disadvantaged groups (rural people in particular) through college education. A manuscript based on the ideas of this chapter will be submitted to <em>Research in</em> <em>Social Stratification and Mobility</em>.</p>
<p>After looking into the overall relationships among social origin, educational attainment, and social destination under educational expansion, my third empirical chapter examines changes in the earning returns to college education across time and investigates who have benefited first and most in earnings from educational expansion. By using a wide source of available data, my analysis shows that college premium (the earning gap between college vs. high school graduates) is monotonically declining between 2003 and 2008 even when controlling for cohort quality and labor market supply measures. This trend holds not only for the entire active labor force, but is especially salient for cohorts who have been affected by the college educational expansion policy in 1999 (the ones who were born after 1980). In addition, for these particular birth cohorts, the effects of father’s education and class background on college premium increase from 2003 to 2008, and the urban-rural (defined by <em>hukou</em> origin) odds of college premium are also increasing as demonstrated by propensity score matching results. It is therefore evident that it is the children from better-off families and urban areas that benefit first and most in earnings from the college expansion. I argue that these patterns can be explained by the processes of how educational expansion shapes the origin-education-destination relationships. A manuscript of this chapter will be submitted to <em>American Sociological Review</em>. </p>
<p>In addition to my dissertation work, I am currently working on two stand-alone research projects. The manuscripts from these projects are in preparation for submission to peer-reviewed journals. A common thread of the projects is that I seek to understand how various social mechanisms <em>causally</em> contribute to the stratification patterns and individuals’ different life chances in the context of contemporary China. This is done by making the conceptual and analytical distinction between the effect of social positions, and the effect of individuals’ access/selection into such positions.</p>
<p>My second ongoing project focuses on an institution that is specifically pertaining to the Chinese case, i.e. the work unit system and its role in creating economic inequality and life chance differentials, while at the same time aims to contribute to organizational studies in general. Despite the scholarly attention given to the Chinese work unit system to date, existing research has largely neglected the conceptual difference between the inequality associated with work unit positions <em>per se</em> and the inequality generated by the differential selection processes into those positions. Different social groups, using distinctive rationales and facing different institutional constraints, self-select themselves into various social positions - and such processes have gone largely under-studied in organizational studies. Indeed, my empirical research on the patterns of external job-shifts into different types of work units has found that different social groups have embraced the expanded market opportunity at different paces, which is demonstrated by a clear selective job mobility process into the state and the market sector. Using matching techniques to estimate the organizational premium of the work units on their employee’s income, and quantitatively decomposing the effects of work unit positions and of individuals’ self-selection, I find that the market reform reinforces the advantages of workers in the government/state institutes. Compared to their counterparts in the market sector, they now enjoy greater advantages in opportunities and economic outcomes and have reversed their disadvantages in the 1990s. The draft based on these results, in collaboration with Prof. Xiaogang Wu, has been submitted to <em>Social Forces</em>. Building on the theoretical notion of segregated labor market, the next step of the project is to investigate the relative importance of work units across time, in particular, what the structural determinants of individuals’ opportunities for entering various work units are, and how individuals develop and frame their own mobility strategy in response. </p>
<p>My third ongoing project considers the particular political mechanism that shapes the stratification patterns in contemporary China by focusing on the role of Communist party membership in determining individuals’ socioeconomic success. Existing research has documented a strong association between party membership and significantly higher economic returns as well as greater career development and life chances. What is yet to be understood is whether the advantageous effects of party membership comes from belonging to the party <em>per se</em>, or rather, it represents the unobservable-and hardly quantifiable-individual attributes that leads to individuals’ selection into the Communist party. To decompose the effects of party membership, I ask: does party membership bring equal premium to all party members? Adopting the analytical approach of causal inference analysis, I illustrate that party sponsorship and political incorporation are two different mechanisms that the Communist party uses to recruit its members, and such heterogeneity within the party member recruitment process is associated with the heterogeneity of the income premiums brought by party membership. This paper is currently under revision to be submitted to <em>Research in</em> <em>Social Stratification and Mobility</em>. The next step of the project is to see whether the importance of party membership is increasing or declining as more and more party members have been recruited by the Communist party through the two different mechanisms, and identify the groups that are sponsored or incorporated. </p>
<p><strong>Perceptions of Inequality and Mobility: Response, Perceptions and Sense-Making</strong></p>
<p>Given the importance of self-selection and sorting processes for understanding current stratification patterns, my second line of research turns to people’s subjective perceptions of inequality and mobility. In the context of reforming China, I ask: how does the existing inequality trend map onto Chinese individuals’ subjective perception of social inequality? How do contemporary Chinese citizens make sense of the notion of “success” and subsequently view their own mobility chances? </p>
<p>Working with Prof. Martin Whyte, I examine the extent to which the Chinese citizens are angry about current social inequalities. The analysis is based on two waves of Distributive Justice Survey administered in 2004 and 2009. Our result shows that Chinese citizens in general do not appear to be as upset about the size and severity of current inequalities as many analysts have assumed. Comparing to other societies, Chinese individuals place a much greater emphasis on the merit-based attributes as the main reasons explaining why certain individuals are able to obtain socioeconomic success. Moreover, we find that China’s most disadvantaged social group, i.e. the rural farmers, is not the angriest about current patterns of social inequality. A paper based on these results is published in 2009 <em>Social Transformations in Chinese Societies.</em> </p>
<p>Following this, my next step is to study the subjective-objective linkage of current inequalities. Particularly, I focus on the importance of “meritocracy” in Chinese citizens’ perception and framing of social inequality and mobility. Drawing on both survey data and qualitative interviews, I ask: how do people subjectively view the importance of meritocracy in China from a longitudinal perspective? To what extent are people’s beliefs in meritocracy related to their objective SES and subjective evaluation of current inequalities? How do contemporary Chinese citizens develop a narrative about why certain individuals are able to get ahead- and how they frame their own mobility strategy in response? Through these questions, I aim to incorporate the analytical tool of “framing” within cultural sociology into current inequality research, and understand how people choose and make sense of their mobility strategies. </p>
<p>My long term research agenda is to expand my current work on identifying the <em>casual</em> mechanisms that shape and strengthen the inequality trends and stratification patterns, by explicitly considering the sorting and selectivity processes through which different social groups end up in various social positions. My goal is to not only provide solid descriptions of the trend of social inequality and stratification patterns in contemporary China, but also to engage in dialogue with the general literature and build up theoretical frameworks that explain the production and reproduction of social stratification. I aim to utilize longitudinal and international data and situate the case of China in a comparative and historical context. </p>
